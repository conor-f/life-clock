# life-clock
A countdown timer of the seconds left in your life. Simply sits in your Gnome toolbar and ticks down the time.
It adds some colour between white and red to attract your attention each time a significant digit is about to roll over.

Get it from the gnome shell extensions site: https://extensions.gnome.org
